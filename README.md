# basic_roguelike
This is my first repository on github. I have recently finished my first C
programming course and am working on this project to get some more experience
working with the language. I also want to make sure I keep writing code through
this semester, as none of my courses require much coding at the moment.

Keep in mind that I am a complete noob when it comes to C, and any advice
regarding specific modifications & approaches to my project code as well as
general information about best practices would be very much appreciated :)
