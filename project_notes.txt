Project Name: basic_roguelike
Creator: Joseph A.
Start Date: 10 Jan 2015


OVERVIEW:

All header files are currently located in the "resources" directory. At the
moment, my inclusion system is very sloppy. The existing header files will need
to be restructured, renamed, etc. I plan on looking into the Deep C
presentations and existing github projects in order to determine what the best
approach will be for structuring my project.

The project will also need to be migrated over to one of my Raspberry Pi
computers as it matures. More than likely I will still probably be accessing it
via SSH, but it will allow me to install and utilize additional libraries. I
would also like for the life of this project to extend past my graduation date.


CURRENT EXECUTABLES:

printing_test.c:
This file is designed to test the various possibilities of printing colored
output using ansi escape codes.

test.c:
This file is designed to test the actual implementation of the various aspects
of rougulikes such as map representation, movement, attack, defense, etc.


CURRENT HEADERS:

display.h
This file contains the definitions of various ansi escape sequences used to
print formatted output as well as enums for the character representations of
various symbols from cp437.

kbhit.h
This file, provided by Chris Giese, provides the kbhit() and getch functions
used to listen for and retrieve raw, single-character input from the keyboard.

maps.h
This file was being used as a dump file for structs/methods that required the
inclusion of multiple header files in the resources folder. It has been renamed
and is intended to be a location for map-related structs and methods.

monster.h
This file is used for structs/methods related to monsters and their generation.
This may also be the location of monster AI's in the future, but depending on
how complex they get, they might require their own header or maybe data files.

movement.h
This file contains the methods required to move monsters in the 8 possible
directions in a 2-dimensional map constructed of Tile structs.
